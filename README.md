# ScalaxHack 2016

We'll arrange a schedule on the day based on what peoples' interests.
We'll aim to have a mix of hacking and short talks/workshops.
This is a collection of ideas and proposals.

## Workshop Proposals

Ideas for talks, round-tables, and interactive sessions.
Anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes in length.
Sessions will be voted on unconference-style,
so some suggestions may not be taken up on the day.

  (talk, hands-on workshop, round-table, etc)
  and the topic of discussion.
  Please keep descriptions short.
  Feel free to link to extra information.
  Let people know if they need laptops and
  provide pointers to setup instructions if required.
