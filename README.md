# ScalaxHack 2016

Topic and project suggestions for ScalaxHack 2016.

We'll arrange a schedule on the day based on what peoples' interests.
We'll aim to have a mix of hacking and short talks/workshops.
This is a collection of ideas and proposals.

## Projects to hack on

Have a project you'd like to bring to the hack day? 
Send us a PR to list it here! Here's an example:

- **Example Person, Example Library**

  http://github.com/example-person/example-library

  Include a quick description of the library 
  and what you'd like to work on at the hack day.
  Please keep descriptions short.
  Feel free to link to extra information.
  We suggest including a link to your issue tracker
  and highlighting simple issues for newcomers.

- **Miles Sabin, Typelevel Scala Compiler**

  http://github.com/typelevel/scala

  Compiler hacking is fun and not as scary as you might think.
  In this session we'll fork, clone, build, tweak, 
  and use the Typelevel Scala compiler 
  as an introduction to compiler hacking.

- **Eugene Burmako, Scala.Meta and Macro Paradise**

  Hackathon on scala.meta and new-style macros.
  We'll have a bunch of approachable issues for newcomers.

## Workshop Proposals

Ideas for talks, round-tables, and interactive sessions.
Anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes in length.
Sessions will be voted on unconference-style,
so some suggestions may not be taken up on the day.

- **Example Person, Example Workshop, about 30 minutes**

  http://example.com/link-to-external-material-if-applicable

  A short description of the session format
  (talk, hands-on workshop, round-table, etc)
  and the topic of discussion.
  Please keep descriptions short.
  Feel free to link to extra information.
  Let people know if they need laptops and
  provide pointers to setup instructions if required.
